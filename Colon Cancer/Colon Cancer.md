## Data

The colon cancer data is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images). It consists of:

- **Colon tissue**: A total of 500 images of colon tissue (250 benign colon tissue and 250 colon adenocarcinomas). The dataset has been augmented to 25,000 images using the Augmentor package.

## Model

The repository includes a CNN model for detecting colon cancer from histopathological images. The model is designed to classify images into two categories: benign colon tissue and colon adenocarcinoma.
