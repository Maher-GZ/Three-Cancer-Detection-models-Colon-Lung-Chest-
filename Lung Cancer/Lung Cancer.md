# Lung Cancer Detection using CNN

This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting lung cancer in histopathological images of lung tissue. The data includes images of benign lung tissue, lung adenocarcinomas, and lung squamous cell carcinomas.

## Data

The lung cancer data is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images). It consists of:

- **Lung tissue**: A total of 750 images (250 benign lung tissue, 250 lung adenocarcinomas, and 250 lung squamous cell carcinomas).

## Model

The repository includes a CNN model for detecting lung cancer from histopathological images. The model is designed to classify images into three categories: benign lung tissue, lung adenocarcinomas, and lung squamous cell carcinomas.
